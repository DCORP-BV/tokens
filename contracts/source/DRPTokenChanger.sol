/**
 * @title DRP Token Changer
 *
 * This contract of this VC platform token changer will allow anyone with a current balance of DRP, 
 * to deposit it and in return receive DRPU, or DRPS.
 *
 * DRPU as indicated by its ‘U’ designation is Dcorp’s utility token for those who are under strict 
 * compliance within their country of residence, and does not entitle holders to profit sharing.
 *
 * DRPS as indicated by its ‘S’ designation, maintaining the primary security functions of the DRP token 
 * as outlined within the Dcorp whitepaper. Those who bear DRPS will be entitled to profit sharing in the 
 * form of dividends as per a voting process, and is considered the "Security" token of Dcorp.
